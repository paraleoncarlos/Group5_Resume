                                What makes Jacob unique is his professional programming career - many instructors have never programmed professionally, let alone had a distinguished professional development career like Jacob.
                                
                                 Jacob as trained over 786,000 students how to program, way more than a typical IT Professor at a college does in a lifetime.</p>
